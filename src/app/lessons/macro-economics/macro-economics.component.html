  <h1>What were some early indicators of the financial crisis in 2008?</h1>
  <h2>DIJA</h2>
  <p>On October 9th, 2008, The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell bellow 9,000 for the first time since 2003. Even before
    that, on September 29th, 2008, the DIJA dropped 777.68 points which was a new record. </p>
  <p>Commercial banks, Insurance companies, Securities firms and investment banks, etc are all Financial Institutions
  </p>
  <h2>TED Spread</h2>
  <img src="../../../assets/images/ted_spread.png">
  <p>Above shows the TED spread during the financial crisis. The <strong>TED Spread</strong> is the difference between
    interest rates on interbank loans (LIBOR) and short-term U.S. government debt (T-Bills). An increase in LIBOR
    indicates the risk premium between banks borrowing from each other has increased, meaning the bank thinks it's
    fellow bank has a chance of defaulting.</p>
  <h2>Other indicators</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Record home foreclosures. 1 in 45 homes defaulted in late 2008.</li>
    <li>AIG (American International Group) bailout</li>
    <li>Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were the only survivors of the investment banks</li>
    <li>Citigroup needed government support</li>
    <li>Chrysler and GM declared bankruptcy in 2009</li>
    <li>Unemployment in excess of 10%</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Financial Institutions</h1>
  <p>The purpose of financial institutions are is that they connect households (net savers) with corporations (net
    borrowers) by the user of cash, equity, and debt.</p>
  <p>Without FI's, there would be a maturity mismatch between the supply and demand. In addition, there would be a
    liquidity risk. Liquidity is the ease with which an asset may be traded, or the ease with which an asset can be
    converted to cash.</p>
  <p>The benefits of FI are diversification from the law of large numbers and predicable returns. They also utilize
    hedging due to their access to superior hedging instruments, and risk management skills.</p>

  <h1>Adverse Selection Problem</h1>
    <p>There is a problem of asymetric information where firm's managers know more than investors. If an investor wants to buy equity in a firm, we will overvalue bad firms and undervalue good firms. FI's have information to help them fight against asymteric information.</p>
  <h2>Principle-agent relation/Moral Hazard</h2>
  <p>We are the principal, and the companies we own stock of are our agents. Sometimes the agent doesn't have the best
    interest of the us (principal). One example of this is moral hazard (company CEO uses a helicopter to go golfing
    with clients).</p>
    <p>We don't have expertise, so we must hire the companies to work for us.</p>
  <p>FI's have information and monitoring power to avoid the asymmetrical information and moral hazard problems</p>
  <p><strong>Screening Process</strong> - Loan offices of a bank will screen a firm before the firm can borrow money</p>
  <p>Venture Capital firms use Stage Financing to provide funding at different phases. Eash phase of funding is
    conditional upon the performance during the previous stage. This is an example of FI's mitigating the information
    problem.</p>
  <h2>Collateral</h2>
  <p>When firms default, their assets can be collected and sold on the secondary market to recoup some of the losses.
  </p>
  <p>During the financial crisis TARP and Capital Purchase Program funds were used to help prevent FI's from failing.
    This was important since one FI's failure will increase the chances due for other FI's to fail around it. (Due to
    bank runs and banks holding each other's or similar assets).</p>
  <h2>Are FIs still special?</h2>
  <h3>Are they still too big to fail?</h3>
  <p>Trends in the US</p>
  <p>Decline in share of depository institutions and insurance companies. There are increases in investment companies.
  </p>
  <p>FI's would "Originate and Distribute" where they would create loans for people, and sell these risky loans to other
    FIs. After they sell these loans to another FI, they stop monitoring the loans. When every bank does this, lots of
    bad loans enter the market. When something goes wrong, lots of these loans default, causing more defaults to happen.
    This is how the subprime mortgage crisis happened.</p>
